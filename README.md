Video Game-loops written in Java. Programming assignment for COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming) at UCF.

Billy loves video games! in fact, he spends all of his money on them. He has a weekly allowance and each game costs
a certain amount of money. (Both of these are values entered by the user.) The program will simulate Billy's spending
habits for a particular number of weeks (values also entered by the user). At the end of each week, the program will
print whether or not Billy buys a video game. Also, any money not spent on a video game carries over to the following week.
At the end of the program, it will print how much money Billy has left and how many video games he has bought.
